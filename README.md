# [Máni](#) &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/VeenixDev/mani?style=flat)]()

Máni is a HTTP-Server implementation.

- **Lightweight**: Máni is built very simple and only with necessary and **some** quality of life features!
- **Plugins**: If you think, I would want to have that feature but it's not already included in Máni then you can simply add it by writing a plugin. The Plugins are loaded into the server with nearly no performance loss
- **Resource Efficient**: With the small size and the focus on small environments, Máni doesn't waste resources on features needed only in enterprise environments
- **A couple of clicks**: With only a couple of clicks you can use plugins and the config to use Máni on an enterprise scale
